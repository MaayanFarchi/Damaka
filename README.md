# Damka
-A a basic Damaka Windows desktop application using .NET WinForms
-A OOP architecture that applies segregation between the Classes who manage the logics and data of the game and the Classes who are responsible for the UI and User Interactions. 
-The program allows two human players to play against eachother by turns, or for 
a human player to play against the computer which randomly chooses a move out of 
the current set of legal moves. 
-The game is designed in a way that events are raised from the 
Logic Layer and handled in the UI layer for updating the display.
